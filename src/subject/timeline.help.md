The Imaging Visit Timeline shows the MR sessions in the context of
the patient encounters and treatments. The timeline starts with the
first encounter or treatment date and ends with the latest such date,
or today if a treatment is ongoing. The encounters are displayed as
the &nabla; symbol, the treatments are solid bars, and the imaging
sessions are represented by the sequential session number.
