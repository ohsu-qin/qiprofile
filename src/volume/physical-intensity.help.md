The Physical Intensity Gradient depicts the spatial intensity in
the neighborhood of the current coordinate over time. The voxel
intensity values for each anatomical dimension is shown as a line.
The line color matches the dimension label as follows:

* `L-R` - median or sagittal plane (left-right)
* `A-P` - frontal or coronal plane (anterior-posterior)
* `I-S` - transverse or axial plane (inferior-superior)

Each gradient line shows a window into the 50 voxel intensities
to either side of the current coordinate in the image view.
The gradient direction follows the image view orientation as
follows:

* `L-R` - moving left to right in the axial view moves from left
  to right in the sagittal gradient line
* `A-P` - moving left to right in the sagittal view moves from left
  to right in the coronal gradient line
* `I-S` - moving down to up in the coronal view moves from left
  to right in the axial gradient line
