This page shows the correlation between pharmacokinetic modeling
results and clinical data. Each of the four interactive scatter
charts has a different pair of imaging and clinical parameter
axes. Use the drop-down menus to choose which data are plotted
along the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes in the charts.

The left-most Sessions Chart shows the sessions for each subject.
The X axis is the MR visit day relative to the first visit.
The Y axis is the subject number. Clicking on a subject number
navigates to that subject's detail page.

All MR sessions for the given imaging collection are initially
represented. Filter the sessions by clicking and dragging over
one or more plotted data points in any chart. All of the charts
will be filtered for the selected sessions. Clicking again on
any chart clears the selection and redisplays all of the
sessions.
