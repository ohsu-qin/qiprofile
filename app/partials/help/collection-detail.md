This section displays a series of interactive correlation scatter charts
displaying pharmokinetic modeling results and clinical data for all subjects of
the imaging collection.

Use the dropdown menus to choose which data are plotted along the X
(horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes in any chart.

You can filter data by clicking and dragging over one or more plotted data
points in any chart. They will be encapsulated by a grey box. Only the
corresponding subjects and visits will be visible in the other charts, and the
rest hidden. Click anywhere on the chart outside of the grey box to cancel the
selection and make all data visible.
