Overview
--------
The Quantitative Imaging Profile
(<em>Q<span class='qi-x-smaller'>I</span>P<span class='qi-x-smaller'>R</span></em>
 <button class="btn btn-sm qi-btn" type='button' onclick='new Audio("static/media/QiPr1.mp3").play()'>
   <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-volume-up"></span>
 </button>)
application helps clinicians and imaging scientists
correlate imaging analysis results with clinical outcomes.

Collections
-----------
The imaging collections are listed with a brief description. Click
on the collection name to view the summary patient clinical and
imaging information. Click on the
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> button to the
right of the row to view the collection acquisition method details.

Navigation
----------
<em>Q<span class='qi-x-smaller'>I</span>P<span class='qi-x-smaller'>R</span></em>
is intended to be used in its own tab. Navigation between
<em>Q<span class='qi-x-smaller'>I</span>P<span class='qi-x-smaller'>R</span></em>
pages within the browser history is nearly instantaneous.
Open a non-<em>Q<span class='qi-x-smaller'>I</span>P<span class='qi-x-smaller'>R</span></em>
page in a different tab in order to ensure the application
continuity and performance.
