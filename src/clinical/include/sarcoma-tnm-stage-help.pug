    | The American Joint Committee on Cancer has designated staging by
    | the four criteria of tumor size (T), spread to lymph nodes (N),
    | the presence of distant metastasis (M), and histologic grade to
    | define soft tissue sarcomas. A three-grade system (G1â€“G3) is based
    | on cellular differentiation, mitotic count, and extent of tumor
    | necrosis. If metastasis exists (M1), then the stage is IV.
    | Otherwise, the stage (I, II, or III) is determined by the T and N scores and
    | the grade.<sup>1</sup>
