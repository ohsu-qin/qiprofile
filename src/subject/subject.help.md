This page displays the Imaging and Clinical profiles side by side.

Imaging Profile
--------------
On the left, the Imaging Profile displays a summary patient timeline,
the imaging session dates, scan previews (if available)
and the pharmacokinetic modeling results. Clicking on an imaging
session date opens the detail page for that session.

Clinical Profile
----------------
On the right, the Clinical Profile displays the patient demographics
followed by the patient encounter outcomes. Each outcome panel shows
the encounter type, e.g. Biopsy, encounter date and the outcomes.
The Tumor Staging panel shows the TNM scores, Stage and Grade.
The grade is computed from the detailed grade for the specific
tumor type, e.g. the ModifiedBloomRichardson Grade for a breast tumor.
The stage is then computed from the size, lymph status and
TNM grade.
