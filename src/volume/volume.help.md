This page displays the MR image volume and associated overlays.

The image viewer is divided into three views which display volume
slices in the axial (superior-inferior), sagittal (right-left), and
coronal (anterior-posterior) planes. Drag the crosshairs to control the
cross-sectional slicing of the volume in the three dimensions. Click on
the **Swap View** button to cycle the slice views in a clockwise rotation.
Re-center the image in all planes with the **Go To Center** button.

Move the Time Point slider or use the left
<span class="fa fa-step-backward"></span> and right
<span class="fa fa-step-forward"></span> buttons to
decrement and increment the time series point. Click on the play
<span class="fa fa-play"></span> button to automatically
advance through the series points. Click on the pause
<span class="fa fa-pause"></span> button to stay at the
current point.

Similarly, the Session controls on the right select the volume at the
same time point for the chosen session number.

Click on the embedded
<span class="fa fa-question-sign"></span>
help buttons for additional information.
