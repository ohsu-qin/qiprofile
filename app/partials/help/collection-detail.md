This section displays interactive scattercharts displaying pharmokinetic
modeling results and clinical data for all subjects of the imaging collection.

The topmost panels contain a list of patient and visit links (on left) and a
corresponding grid (on right). Click on a patient link to open the Imaging
Profile page or a visit link to go to the Session Detail page. You can filter
data in the charts below by clicking and dragging over one or more patient
visits in the grid.

Use the dropdown menus to choose which data are plotted along the X
(horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes in the charts.

Filter data by clicking and dragging over one or more plotted data points in
any chart. They will be encapsulated by a grey box. Only the corresponding
subject and visit data will be visible in the other charts, and the rest
hidden. Click anywhere on the chart outside of the grey box to cancel the
selection and make all data visible.
