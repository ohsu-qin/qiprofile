This page displays the MR image volume and associated overlays.

The image viewer is divided into three viewports which display volume slices in
the axial (superior-inferior), saggital (left-right), and coronal
(anterior-posterior) planes. Drag the crosshairs to control the cross-sectional
slicing of the volume in the three dimensions. Click on the **Swap View** button
to cycle the slice views in a clockwise rotation. Re-center the image in all
planes with the **Go To Center** button.

Move the Time Point slider or use the left
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-step-backward"></span> and right
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-step-forward"></span> buttons to decrement and
increment the time series point. Click on the play
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span> button to automatically advance
through the series points. Click on the pause
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pause"></span> button to stay at the current
point.

The viewer **Help** menu provides more information about using keystrokes and
mouse gestures to manipulate the volume display.
