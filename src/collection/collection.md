This page shows the correlation between pharmokinetic modeling results and
clinical data. Each of the four interactive scatter charts has a different
pair of imaging and clinical parameter axes. Use the drop-down menus to
choose which data are plotted along the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes
in the charts.

All MR sessions for the given imaging collection are initially represented.
Filter data by clicking and dragging over one or more plotted data points in
any chart. The selection will be indicated by a box, while the unselected
data points will shrink. Only the corresponding subject and visit data will be
visible in the other charts. Click anywhere on the chart outside of the selection
box to cancel the selection and make all data visible.

The patients and MR sessions are shown in the two topmost panels. The top left
panel contains a list of patient and visit links. The top right panel displays
the same patients and visits as a grid. Click on a patient link in the list to
open the Patient Profile page. Click on a visit link to open the Session Detail
page.
