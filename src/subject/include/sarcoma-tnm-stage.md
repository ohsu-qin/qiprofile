The American Joint Committee on Cancer has designated staging by the four
criteria of tumor size (T), spread to lymph nodes (N), the presence of distant
metastasis (M), and histologic grade to define soft tissue sarcomas. A
three-grade system (G1â€“G3) is based on cellular differentiation, mitotic count,
and extent of tumor necrosis. If metastasis exists (M1), then the stage is IV.
Otherwise, the stage (I, II, or III) is determined by the T and N scores and
the grade.<sup>1</sup>
